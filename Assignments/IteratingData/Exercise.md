# Iterating Exercise
1. Given the following empty array, write a ```for``` loop to fill it with **every integer from -100 to 100:**
```Java
    int[] nums = new int[201];

```

2. Write a **second loop** that uses your ```nums``` array to **print the absolute value of each number in the array.**

3. Write code to fill an array with the **first 1000 numbers in the fibonacci sequence. Print each number.**
    * The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
    * The first two numbers in the fibonnaci sequence are ```0``` and ```1```
        * So ```fibonacci[0] = 0``` and ```fibonacci[1] = 1```
        * ```fibonacci[2]``` is equal to ```fibonacci[0]``` (or 0), + ```fibonacci[1]``` (or 1). 

4. Assuming you have an array of integers ```int[] numbers``` of unknown length, write a ```foreach``` loop that will print any value in the array that **is an odd number.**

5. Assuming you have an array of Strings ```String[] messages``` of unknown length, write a ```foreach``` loop that will print any value in the array that **has more than 10 characters.**
