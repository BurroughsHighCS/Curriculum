# 2D Array Practice

1. Write a loop that fills a matrix with the following values:

```
[2, 4, 8]
[3, 9, 27]
[4, 16, 64]
```

Write a function `printMatrix(int[][] mat)` that uses a foreach loop to print all the values of the matrix. Print your matrix.

2. Use your `reverseMatrix(int[][] mat)` function from last week to reverse the matrix.

Use your `printMatrix(int[][] mat)` function from problem 1 to print the matrix and verify that it was reversed correctly.
