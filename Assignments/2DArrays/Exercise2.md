# 2D Array Exercise 2

1. Write a function `int[][] reverseMatrix(int[][] mat)` which takes a two-dimensional array of any dimensions and reverse all of the entries inside of it.

Example:
Given the following `mat`:
```Java
    //[1,2,3]
    //[4,5,6]
    //[7,8,9]
```

The result of the function call `reverseMatrix(mat)` would return:

```Java
    //[9,8,7]
    //[6,5,4]
    //[3,2,1]
```

* Hint: You may want to also write a function `int[] reverseRow(int[] arr)` that reverses the elements of a regular array.
