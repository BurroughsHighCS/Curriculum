# Arrays Exercise
1. Write down the expected printouts of each print statement in the following code (Writing them in your code file as comments next to the print statement will suffice):
```Java
    int numArray = {20, 3, 6, 10, 13, 25, 100, 6, 3, 20, 5102};

    System.out.println( numArray[3] );

    System.out.println( numArray[11] );

    System.out.println( numArray[1] );

    System.out.println( numArray[7] );

    System.out.println( numArray[8] );
```

2. Print the following values from the provided array:
    * 13
    * 3
    * 5102
    * 25
    * 20

```Java
    int numArray = {20, 3, 6, 10, 13, 25, 100, 6, 3, 20, 5102};

```

3. Fill out the fibonacci sequence in the following array (Change any 0's so they equal the sum of the two values before it). Print any value you update:

```Java
    int[] fibonacci = {1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 8, 13, 0, 34, 0};
    
```
