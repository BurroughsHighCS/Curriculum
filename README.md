# Curriculum

## Learning Objectives
Objectives for the course will follow those prescribed by the College Board in their Computer Science A class curriculum:

Students should learn to:
* design, implement, and analyze solutions to problems.
* use and implement commonly used algorithms.
* use standard data structures.
* develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve new problems.
* write solutions fluently in an object-oriented paradigm.
* write, run, test, and debug solutions in the Java programming language, utilizing standard Java library classes and interfaces from the AP Java subset.
* read and understand programs consisting of several classes and interacting objects.
* read and understand a description of the design and development process leading to such a program.
* understand the ethical and social implications of computer use.

While we will aim for these objectives, note that our time this semester is limited, and certain skills may be prioritized over others as we approach the AP exam.

## Grading and the AP exam
I am unable to give you a grade that factors into your GPA this semester. Consider this both a blessing and a curse. If you struggle with projects, your GPA won't suffer. But the lack of a grade also means you will need to be self-motivated to learn the material.

Your primary motivator this semester should be to pass the AP Exam. Should you pass the exam with a 3 or higher, most universities will grant you full credit for having completed their entry level Computer Science course. This will save you both time and money in college.

You will need to complete every assignment and every project if you wish to learn the material. For most assignments, the time in class will be sufficient. For some of you, this will NOT be the case on some of the projects. Time to complete projects often varies by student, and I cannot budget too many days of class to any given project.

### Workload

#### Projects
Projects will consist of more comprehensive practices in programming spanning 1 or more weeks to help you internalize the skills you learn from other assignments. Computer Science is a skill that requires many hours of labor at your keyboard trying to learn how to work in digital memory. Because of the nature of grading in our class, We will be unable to do these projects to quite the level of rigor that we should, and we will not do nearly as many as we should.

All Projects will be graded for all-or-nothing credit. Group work is prohibited on all projects unless otherwise stated.

Projects and grades listed below are subject to change, but tentatively our big projects will be as follows:

* Loan Calculator
* Plinko Game
* Tournament Classes Project
* Fibonacci
* Loan Calculator++ (Possibly)

#### Assignments
Assignments will range from simple skill practice to learning concepts and techniques that will be critical to success in the above projects.

Each assignment will be worth 2 Coins and will be graded as an all-or-nothing grade. Assignments have no late penalties.

The order and details of the assignments listed below are subject to change:

* Terminal Commands (Hello World)
* Git Commands
* Operators
* Data Types
* Variable Scoping
* Binary & Base n Number Systems
* Arrays
* Loops
* 2D Arrays
* Functions
* Multi-Class Intro
* Inheritance
* Class Diagram
* Public/Private Inheritance
* Sorting
* Recursion
* 1-5 More Assignments TBD as required

#### Practice Exams / Midterms
We will do at least three practice AP exams. All of them will consist of two parts: Multiple Choice and Free Response.

One will happen around March, and two more right before the AP exam.

## Policies

### Cheating
Cheating consists of copying work done by another student. Students are not allowed to borrow code in any amount from other students on projects. All projects are considered individual work, and each individual student must find their way to solutions by themselves. If you need help with a project, email me or stay late Wednesday mornings. I will gladly help you through problems, or point you to resources which will help you through these problems.

While assignments are open to group work, please do not copy the work of others. Assignments suspected of copying will be reviewed with students in question, and their scores will potentially be invalidated as well.

### Inappropriate Behavior
In addition to the existing school policies, any student exhibiting inappropriate behavior in class is subject disciplinary action.

I will tolerate no sexually inappropriate, offensive, or discriminatory behavior of any kind in my classroom.

Do not attempt to "hack" or otherwise abuse our school machines.

Additionally, I will watch for students who abuse their digital footprint by:
* Submitting code with inappropriate variable names or otherwise inappropriate content.
* Posting inappropriate content of any kind to github.
* Exhibiting behaviors deemed otherwise inappropriate online.
