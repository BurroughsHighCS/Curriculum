# Curriculum

## Learning Objectives
Objectives for the course will follow those prescribed by the College Board in their Computer Science A class curriculum:

Students should learn to:
* design, implement, and analyze solutions to problems.
* use and implement commonly used algorithms.
* use standard data structures.
* develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve new problems.
* write solutions fluently in an object-oriented paradigm.
* write, run, test, and debug solutions in the Java programming language, utilizing standard Java library classes and interfaces from the AP Java subset.
* read and understand programs consisting of several classes and interacting objects.
* read and understand a description of the design and development process leading to such a program.
* understand the ethical and social implications of computer use.

While we will aim for these objectives, note that our time this semester is limited, and certain skills may be prioritized over others as we approach the AP exam.

## Grading and the AP exam
I am unable to give you a grade that factors into your GPA this semester. Consider this both a blessing and a curse. If you struggle with projects, your GPA won't suffer. But the lack of a grade also means you will need to be self-motivated to learn the material.

Your primary motivator this semester should be to pass the AP Exam. Should you pass the exam with a 3 or higher, most universities will grant you full credit for having completed their entry level Computer Science course. This will save you both money and time in college.

I will treat the coursework as I would if I were teaching a normal class. Your assignments will be graded. You will have deadlines and late penalties.

Additionally, we will use a "currency" known as BCSCoins (Burroughs Computer Science Coins). These will be an in-class currency (Not a full blown cryptocurrency) I will award to you based on your performance on assignments and projects. Sometime during the semester, I hope to work with some STEM-focused non-profits in Ridgecrest to make these coins redeemable for real rewards, such as Amazon gift cards.

### Assignments and Grade Distribution

#### Projects (58 Coins Possible)
Projects will consist of week-long, comprehensive practices in programming to help you internalize the skills you learn from other assignments. Computer Science is a skill that requires many hours of labor at your keyboard trying to learn how to work in digital memory.

All Projects will be graded for all-or-nothing credit. Each assignment will be penalized 1 coin for every 2 days it's late, up to 50% of the possible coins rounded down. Group work is prohibited on all projects unless otherwise stated. Students caught submitting the work of another student will receive no credit for assignments in violation of this policy.

Projects and grades listed below are subject to change, but tentatively our big projects will be as follows:

* Plinko Game (10 coins)
* Loan Calculator (5 coins)
* Loan Calculator++ (5 coins)
* TBD Count, Sort, Search, Manipulate Project (12 coins)
* TBD Classes Project (12 coins)
* TBD Unit Tests Project (8 coins)
* Fibonacci (6 coins)

#### Assignments (36 Coins Possible)
Assignments will range from simple skill practice to learning concepts and techniques that will be critical to success in the above projects.

Each assignment will be worth 2 Coins and will be graded as an all-or-nothing grade. Assignments have no late penalties.

The order and details of the assignments listed below are subject to change:

* Hello World
* Terminal Commands
* Binary
* Manual Code Output
* Google Search
* Variable Scoping
* Nested Functions
* Memory
* Iteration
* Sorting
* Class Diagram
* Inheritance
* Public/Private Inheritance
* Boundary Case Identification
* Unit Test Cases
* Ethics
* TBD Assignment
* TBD Assignment

#### Practice Exams / Midterms (18 Coins Possible)
We will do three practice AP exams. All of them will consist of two parts: Multiple Choice and Free Response.

One will happen in Early March, and two more right before the AP exam. Each of these will be worth 6 coins.

#### Final Grade
Note that there are 112 total coins possible. 100 coins will be considered a 90% grade in the class.

Assuming I can get coin redemption working, expect each 25 coins to be worth a $5 reward, with up to 100 coins redeemable per student.

BCSCoins are a non-tradable currency.

## Inappropriate Behavior Policies
In addition to the existing school policies, any student exhibiting inappropriate behavior in class is subject to immediate coin deductions based on the severity of the infraction.

I will tolerate no sexually inappropriate, offensive, or discriminatory behavior of any kind in my classroom.

Additionally, I will deduct coins and invalidate assignment scores from students who abuse their digital footprint by:
* Submitting code with inappropriate variable names or otherwise inappropriate content.
* Posting inappropriate content of any kind to github.
* Exhibiting behaviors deemed otherwise inappropriate online.
