NOTE: Page 378 of your AP Prep Book has an excellent summary of the skills you should focus on in your AP prep.

# Wrap-up prep work
In class we've covered nearly everything we can afford to cover at some level. We have touched on nearly 90% of the material that can appear on the exam in some way, shape or form.

But the material we've covered can appear in multiple forms and question you on nuances that we haven't even briefly touched. For this reason, I would not be surprised if most of you struggle with more than 50% of the questions on the exam. All because there are little gaps caused by our lack of time dedicated to each topic.

To fill in these gaps, I **strongly encourage** you to read through and practice the examples in the following sections of the AP Exam Prep book **before the AP Exam**:

NOTES: 
* I recommend that you skip _anything_ with an "Optional" label in the margin of the page.
* Work through all of the questions in each review _before_ you look at the answers.

## April 27-29 (F - Sun)
### Introductory Java Language Features (p. 67)
This will review your knowledge of some of the basics. It will also explain in more detail some of the basics that we have barely discussed (like Javadoc comments). We have _used_ everything in this section, even if we haven't sat down and discussed it.

Every question on the exam will use this material in some way, shape, or form.

* Reading: p.67 - p.86
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.87 - p.102


## April 30 - May 3 (Mon - Thur)
### Arrays and ArrayLists (p. 247)
This is the longest review section, but I expect this to be the most frequent topic you encounter on the AP Exam. We use Arrays and Lists **all the time**.

The concepts in this section will probably factor into **over 50%** of the exam's questions.

* Reading: p. 247-269
    * I would consider skipping the following subsections of this reading:
    * All headers between:
        * The Collections API (p. 256)
        * Auto-Boxing and -Unboxing (p. 257)
            * RESUME reading at The List<E> Interface (p. 257)
    * All headers in the section:
        * Collections and Iterators (p. 261 - p. 263)
            * RESUME reading at Two Dimensional Arrays (p. 264)
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.270 - p.305


## May 4 - May 6 (Fri - Sun)
### Classes and Objects (p. 103)
In a year-long class I would spend 3-4 weeks working on basic classes. We spent 2 days on it. Review this section. Make sure you understand how to answer the questions at the end.

**Another 30-40%** of the questions on the exam will use material from this section in some way, shape, or form.

* Reading: p.103 - p.121
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.122 - p.142


## May 7 - May 10 (Mon - Thur)
### Inheritance and Polymorphism (p. 143)
Like basic classes, we would have spent considerably more time on these topics if we had more time. Normally I'd spend 1-2 weeks teaching the basics of these concepts, and have you code a 2-3 week large project the really drive them home. That's 4-5 weeks of content and practice; We spent 1 day learning this and another 2 reviewing it.

Expect roughly 15-25% of the test to use this information. 

* Reading: p.143 - p.163
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.164 - p.187

## May 11 - May 14 (Fri - Mon)
This last leg before the exam you should try to review **two** sections. The first one should be pretty quick, so move through it quickly to have a chance to review recursion at the end. 

If you have to skip one of these, skip Recursion. Recursion is great if it makes sense to you. And I expect there to be maybe 3-6 questions (4-8%) that involve Recursion, but a stronger understanding of the standard classes will benefit you on MOST of the questions.

### Some Standard Classes (p. 194)
These should be pretty basic. We have used all of the content here a lot over the semester, but it is helpful to review them now that you should understand classes better.

* `String` is a class you will use on **more than 50%** of the exam questions. 
    * It is important that you understand the **functions** you can use to decompose and analyze strings. 
* The `Math` class will also be useful and you should expect it to pop up on a handful of questions. 
* You should try to understand the `Object` class as well. 
    * We didn't talk about generic Objects because we ran out of time. But learning about it should shed more light on things like the `toString` methods we wrote for the Student-Grades assignment.

**SKIP** the section about Wrapper classes from p.194 - p.197.
**RESUME** at the section about the Math class on p.197.

Many questions on the test will rely on your understanding of these standard classes.

* Reading: p.188 - p.199
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.200 - p.220

### Recursion (p. 306)
Recursion is really cool, but can be tricky to learn. The best way to learn recursion is honestly just to do several practice questions until it finally clicks. Fit this in if I can, because there will almost definitely be a few questions that use it.

Additionally, understanding recursion will make you inherently better at tracing code execution order, which will make you better at detecting expected outputs without having to run code.

* Reading: p.306 - p.323
* Multiple Choice Review Questions (& Answers): p.324 - p.339
