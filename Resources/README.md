## Software Dependencies
In order to work on class work from home, you will need to install some software. In the computer programming world, we call these "Dependencies". In other words, for my class curriculum to work, I depend on you having this set of software installed. My class work will not work if you don't install the following software:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Optional - if you want something to open single files instead of Visual Studio Code)
* [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
